$TaskName = "Mist Infrastructure Manager"
$ScriptPath = "C:\Users\a-ww31\Desktop\mist-infra-manager\src\main.py"
$PythonPath = "C:\Users\a-ww31\Desktop\mist-infra-manager\.venv\Scripts\python.exe"

# Create trigger
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Once -At (Get-Date) -RepetitionInterval (New-TimeSpan -Minutes 15)

# Create action
$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute $PythonPath -Argument $ScriptPath -WorkingDirectory "C:\Users\a-ww31\Desktop\mist-infra-manager"

# Register task
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName $TaskName -Trigger $Trigger -Action $Action -RunLevel Highest
```

#### Manual Daemon Setup

```powershell
# Start daemon (runs continuously)
.venv\Scripts\python.exe src/main.py --daemon --interval 15

# To stop: Press Ctrl+C
```

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting

**Infrastructure to Monitor:**

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** No reports generated
- Check API token in config.yaml
- Verify network connectivity
- Check Mist organization has sites
- Review logs for errors

**Issue:** Emails not sending
- Verify SMTP server reachable: `Test-NetConnection exchrelay.global.tesco.org -Port 25`
- Check recipient email address valid
- Review logs for SMTP errors
- Verify firewall allows port 25

**Issue:** High memory usage
- Check for report file accumulation in reports/
- Verify history cleanup is running
- Monitor daemon mode for extended periods
- Contact support if persists

### Debug Commands

```powershell
# View last 50 log lines
Get-Content mist_infra_manager.log -Tail 50

# Real-time log monitoring
Get-Content mist_infra_manager.log -Wait

# Search for errors
Get-Content mist_infra_manager.log | Select-String "ERROR|CRITICAL"

# Test SMTP connectivity
Test-NetConnection exchrelay.global.tesco.org -Port 25

# Check report directory size
Get-ChildItem reports -Recurse | Measure-Object -Sum Length
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

1. **Stop Daemon:** Press Ctrl+C or disable scheduled task
2. **Disable Notifications:** Set `notifications.enabled: false` in config.yaml
3. **Revert Code:** `git revert <commit-hash>`
4. **Check Logs:** Review mist_infra_manager.log for issues
5. **Contact Support:** Reference specific error from logs
